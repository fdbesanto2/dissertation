## Supplemental methods
Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; `r eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-ndvi", display = "cite")`) correlates with vegetation density, canopy cover, and leaf area index [@rouse1973]. Normalized difference moisture index (NDMI; `r eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-ndmi", display = "cite")`) correlates with similar vegetation characteristics as NDVI, but doesn't saturate at high levels of foliar biomass [@gao1996, @huesca2016]. Normalized burn ratio (NBR; `r eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-nbr", display = "cite")`) and normalized burn ratio version 2 (NBR2; `r eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-nbr2", display = "cite")`) respond strongly to fire effects on vegetation [@garcia1991; @key2006; @usgs2017a; @usgs2017; @hawbaker2017].

`r eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-ndvi", display = "cite")`: $ndvi = \mathopen(nir - red\mathclose) / \mathopen(nir + red\mathclose)$

`r eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-ndmi", display = "cite")`: $ndmi = \mathopen(nir - swir1\mathclose) / \mathopen(nir + swir1\mathclose)$

`r eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-nbr", display = "cite")`: $nbr = \mathopen(nir - swir2\mathclose) / \mathopen(nir + swir2\mathclose)$

`r eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-nbr2", display = "cite")`: $nbr2 = \mathopen(swir1 - swir2\mathclose) / \mathopen(swir1 + swir2\mathclose)$


Where $nir$ is the near infrared band (band 4 on Landsat 4, 5, and 7; band 5 on Landsat 8) and $red$ is the red band (band 3 on Landsat 4, 5, and 7; band 4 on Landsat 8), $swir1$ is the first short wave infrared band (band 5 on Landsat 4, 5, and 7; band 4 on Landsat 8), $swir2$ is the second short wave infrared band (band 7 on Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8)

```{r eq_dindex, results = "hide"}
eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-dindex")
```

We calculated the delta severity indices (dNBR, dNBR2, dNDVI) by subtracting the respective postfire indices from the prefire indices (NBR, NBR2, and NDVI) without multiplying by a rescaling constant (e.g., we did not multiply the result by 1000 as in @miller2007; `r eq_nums_appendix("eq-dindex", display = "cite")`). Following @reilly2017, we chose not to correct the delta indices using a phenological offset value (typically calculated as the delta index in homogeneous forest patch outside of the fire perimeter), as our approach implicitly accounts for phenology by incorporating multiple cloud-free images across the same time window both before the fire and one year later.

`r eq_nums_appendix("eq-dindex", display = "cite")`: $dI = I_{\text{prefire}} - I_{\text{postfire}}$

```{r eq_rdindex, results = "hide"}
eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-rdindex")
```

We calculated the relative delta severity indices, RdNBR and RdNDVI, by scaling the respective delta indices (dNBR and dNDVI) from `r eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-rdindex", display = "cite")` by a square root transformation of the absolute value of the prefire index.

`r eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-rdindex", display = "cite")`: $RdI = \frac{dI}{\sqrt{abs(I_{\text{prefire}})}}$


```{r eq_rbr, results = "hide"}
eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-rbr")
```

We calculated the relative burn ratio (RBR) following @parks2014a using `r eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-rbr", display = "cite")`.

`r eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-rbr", display = "cite")`: $RBR = \frac{dNBR}{NBR_{\text{prefire}} + 1.001}$


```{r eq-potential-annual-heat-load, results = "hide"}
eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-potential-annual-heat-load")
```

We used the digital elevation model to calculate the potential annual heat load (`r eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-potential-annual-heat-load", display = "cite")` at each pixel, which is an integrated measure of latitude, slope, and a folding transformation of aspect about the northeast-southwest line, such that northeast becomes 0 radians and southwest becomes $\pi$ radians [@mccune2002; with correction in @mccune2007].

(`r eq_nums_appendix(name = "eq-potential-annual-heat-load", display = "cite")`:

$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq-potential-annual-heat-load}
aspect_{folded} &= abs( \pi - abs( aspect - \frac{5\pi}{4}) ) \\
log(pahl) &= \begin{aligned}
&-1.467 + \\
&1.582 * cos(latitude) cos(slope) - \\
&1.5 * cos(aspect_{folded}) sin(slope) sin(latitude) - \\
&0.262 * sin(lat) sin(slope) + \\
&0.607 * sin(aspect_{folded}) sin(slope) \\
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}$

Where $pahl$ is the potential annual heat load, $aspect_{folded}$ is a transformation of aspect in radians, and both $latitude$ and $slope$ are extracted from a digital elevation model with units of radians.
