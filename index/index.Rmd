  "*One thing to remember is to talk to the animals. If you do, they will talk back to you. But if you don’t talk to them, they won’t talk back to you, then you won’t understand. And when you don’t understand, you will fear, and when you fear, you will destroy the animals, and if you destroy the animals, you will destroy yourself*"
